## Introduction

Orn is a strongly typed, C-like programming language designed for **performance** and **clarity**. Its primary goals are **fast single-pass compilation**, **precise error feedback**, and a **clean, maintainable architecture**.

While the current design uses a C-style syntax, the long-term vision is to evolve into a fully **object-oriented language**.

---

## Why?

Many existing compilers trade developer experience for performance, or vice versa. Orn aims to balance both by offering:

* **Clear error feedback** – Error messages are precise and tell you exactly how to fix problems.
* **Fast compile times** – Lightweight single-pass compilation for quick iteration.
* **Strong type guarantees** – Minimize runtime surprises with a robust type system.
* **A foundation for OOP** – Current C-like syntax is just the first step.

---

## Language Goals

* **🎯 Clear Error Feedback** – Errors are actionable and easy to understand
* **⚡ Fast Compilation** – Quick iteration cycles for development
* **🔒 Type Safety** – Strong typing at the core
* **🚀 Path to OOP** – Current syntax is just the beginning
* **🛠️ Simplicity First** – Minimalism without sacrificing power

---

## Performance Architecture

Orn uses a **zero-copy reference design** inspired by production compilers like Clang and Rust:

```
Source Buffer → Tokens → AST → Symbols → Assembly
     ↓         (ptr+len) (ptr+len) (ptr+len)    ↓
   One malloc    ←─── All reference the buffer ──→  New strings
```

**Benefits:**
- Single source allocation, thousands fewer mallocs
- No duplicate string storage throughout pipeline
- Better memory locality and faster compilation
- References become copies only in final assembly output

Traditional compilers duplicate every identifier dozens of times. Orn references the original buffer until code generation.

## Project Status

**Current Phase:** Beta

Orn can already generate x86-64 assembly with working type checking and semantic analysis. Development is focused on extending language features and preparing for future OOP support.

**Implemented Features:**

* Lexer with multi-line comment support
* Full parser with operator precedence
* Type checker and semantic analysis
* x86-64 code generation
* Detailed and precise error reporting
* Functions with definitions and calls

**In Progress:**

* Optimization of generated assembly
* Built-in functions and libraries
* Debugging features
* OOP feature design

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You'll need:

* **[GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/)** or **[Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/)** – C compiler
* **[CMake](https://cmake.org/)** (3.10+) – Build system
* **[Git](https://git-scm.com/)** – Version control
* **[Valgrind](https://valgrind.org/)** *(optional)* – Memory debugging

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Blopaa/Orn.git
cd Orn

# Build the project
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```

You can now run Orn on your own programs:

```bash
./orn program.orn
```

Or, for verbose compilation output:

```bash
./orn --verbose program.orn
```

If you want to **execute the generated assembly**, use:

```bash
cmake --build . --target run_program
```

This will create a `program.orn` file and will execute the asm code generated by this file.

---

## Usage

### Example Program

```c
int x = 42;
float rate = 3.14;
string msg = "Hello, World!";
bool b = true; :: bools and ints cannot mix

x > 0 ? {
   print(msg);
}

while x > 0 {
    print(x);
    x = x - 1;
}

:: simple add function
fn add(a: int, b: int) -> int {
    return a + b;
};

print(add(3, 5));
```

### Error Example

Orn provides actionable error messages:

```
error [E1001]: mismatched types (x)
  --> source.c:2:11
   |
   2 | int x = "hello";
       |           ^
   |
   = expected `int`, found `string`
   = note: string literals cannot be assigned to int variables
   = suggestion: change variable type or cast the value
```
